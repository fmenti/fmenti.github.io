Hi, I'm Franziska! 👋

I am a science support employee 🎓 in astrophysics at ETH Zurich where I work in the exoplanets and habitability group of Prof. Sascha Quanz.
Most of my research is driven by designing and implementing the LIFE (Large Interferometer For Exoplanets) target database.

In my free time, I like interacting with animals🐕, playing (board) games and helping our society become more inclusive!

Please feel free to get in touch! 📧
