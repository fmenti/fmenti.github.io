# My Hobbies

I love training animals (especially my cat and my dog), reading fantasy or scify books (especially those from Brandon Sanderson and Michael Sullivan) and playing games (D&D / Pathfinder, tabletop games, computer games,...).

On my daily cat walks I often get asked, how one teaches a cat to walk on a leash or why I even do it. Those and many more questions I address in the next section.


## Cat Training Guide

### Introduction
Let's first cover the four most important questions about what this guide is about:

**What?** Training your cat from small tricks to more difficult ones like leash walking.   
**Why?** Training your cat will give it a sense of accomplishment, strenghten your bond, combat boredom.   
**How?** Cat training is like learning to play an instrument. You have to invest time repeatedly and make sure you start with the basics before trying out something difficult. I will guide you through the individual steps.   
**Who?** I live together with my 15 year old cat Estrella and my 3 years old dog Nayla. My knowledge about cat training comes from watching animal training tv series for decades as well as training my own cat.    

### The Basics
#### The Reward
First you need to find out what motivates your cat for training. It is easiest, if the cat is food motivated but there area alternatives such as vocal praise, brushing, playing etc. If you are not sure which is your cat's favorite treat lay out an assortment of them on a plate and observe which of the treats it eats first. Best you do this test twice with the treats in different distribution because some cats just eat what is nearest to them first while others are more picky. 

#### Cat Perception and Thinking
Cats perceive the world different than humans. From an evolutionary standpoint they are both fierce predators and small enough to be at risk of getting preyed on themselves. This means they can get distracted by sensory stimuly initiating hunting or fight, flight or freeze responses. When training your cat be aware that there are many potential reasons why your cat is not understanding what you want it to do. Estrella often reacts to smells that I can't perceive. When she seems overly distracted I try walking with her to a different spot and asking her to do a basic trick just to check if she can concentrate better at the new location.

#### The First Trick
You might have heard of clicker training already. It is a form of training where the desired behaviour gets marked by a click from a clicker (or alternatively another sound e.g. what a retractable pen makes when engaged). This is then followed by a reward. The benefit of using a clicker instead of a verbal praise is that it always sounds the same. I have used clicker training and usually still do when teaching a new trick. However, I find it difficult to stick to it during normal training sessions. So my advise is to use it if you can but don't fret if you can't. If you do want to start using clicker training you should start by associating the click with the reward. Don't ask anything yet of your cat, simply click and right afterwards offer the reward. Do this a couple of times till when hearing the click your cat expects to be given the reward.
Which kind of tricks your cat likes depends on it's character. Estrella loves jumping ones. It will be easier to train your cat those she offers on her own. Regardless, the first trick I would recommend is "Target".

### Further Training

#### Medical training

#### Leash Walking
I post pictures of my cat walks on instagram. Feel free to have a look at them by clicking on the instagram symbol at the bottom of this page.

##### Equipment

Please don't just expose your cat to the following objects. They need to be introduced slowly and positively.

* A harness: Make sure it 
* A leash: 
* A save container for putting the cat into when there is danger around e.g. unknown off leash dog. I like to use this backpack because I can also easily carry Estrella to nice places with her and start our walk there.

* A jacket or a towel:

### FAQ's
* **Why do you leash walk your cat?** For my cat the walk on the leash is an adventure compared to the time she has to spend indoors. I use a leash in contrast to letting her walk where she wants to because I live in a suburb environment. The leash lets me prevent Estrella from getting into dangerous situations with cars or dogs.
* **Can only young cats learn to walk on a leash?** Cats can learn new things their whole live just like humans can. Of course it is easier to learn new things when you are younger but that does not mean once we get older we should stop trying to.
