# My Hobbies

I love training animals (especially my cat and my dog), reading fantasy or scify books (especially those from Brandon Sanderson and Michael Sullivan) and playing games (D&D / Pathfinder, tabletop games, computer games,...).

On my daily cat walks I often get asked, how one teaches a cat to walk on a leash or why I even do it. Those and many more questions I address in the next section.


## Cat Training Guide

### Introduction
Let's first cover the four most important questions about what this guide is about:

**What?** Training your cat from small tricks to more difficult ones like leash walking.   
**Why?** Training your cat will give it a sense of accomplishment, strenghten your bond, combat boredom.   
**How?** Cat training is like learning to play an instrument. You have to invest time repeatedly and make sure you start with the basics before trying out something difficult. I will guide you through the individual steps.   
**Who?** I live together with my 15 year old cat Estrella and my 3 years old dog Nayla. My knowledge about cat training comes from watching animal training tv series for decades as well as training my own cat.    

### The Basics
#### The Reward
First you need to find out what motivates your cat for training. It is easiest, if the cat is food motivated but there area alternatives such as vocal praise, brushing, playing etc. If you are not sure which is your cat's favorite treat lay out an assortment of them on a plate and observe which of the treats it eats first. Best you do this test twice with the treats in different distribution because some cats just eat what is nearest to them first while others are more picky. 

#### Cat Perception and Thinking
Cats perceive the world different than humans. From an evolutionary standpoint they are both fierce predators and small enough to be at risk of getting preyed on themselves.

### FAQ's
* **Why do you leash walk your cat?** For my cat the walk on the leash is an adventure compared to the time she has to spend indoors. I use a leash in contrast to letting her walk where she wants to because I live in a suburb environment. The leash lets me prevent Estrella from getting into dangerous situations with cars or dogs.
* **Can only young cats learn to walk on a leash?** Cats can learn new things their whole live just like humans can. Of course it is easier to learn new things when you are younger but that does not mean once we get older we should stop trying to.
