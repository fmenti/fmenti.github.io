# What is Autism?

I like the definition of [Refrainingautism](https://reframingautism.org.au/about-autism/) very well:

"We think of Autism as a brain difference that is basic and fundamental to who we are. This means that Autism is an important part of who we are and the way we are in the world.

Autistic people develop differently to non-autistic people. Autistic people think, move, interact, sense and process differently to what people might expect. We also have more qualities and characteristics in common with other Autistic people than with non-autistic people. Each person is different, but Autistic people will be different to non-autistic people in the way we:

* Socialise and communicate,  including the way we connect, make and understand friendships and relationships, and use speech and body language
* Think and process,  including the way we see patterns and connections, imagine and play, experience and express our senses, emotions and executive functioning, and in the way our brains develop

These differences can look different for children and adults. "

# Vertrausenhund (Assistance dog)

In my day to day life I am supported by my assistance dog for adult autistic people, a so called [Vertrauenshund](vertrauenshund.ch) from [Blindenhundeschule Liestal](https://www.blindenhund.ch).

## Support examples
### Protecting my personal space
By sitting or lying next to me Nayla prevents people from passing by too closely.

### Outing
Like the hidden disability sunflower lanyard also an assistance dog makes people aware that I have special needs.

### Leading through difficult sensory situations
* Out of a building or public transport vehicle
* To a park bank for a break
* To a seat in public transport

# Inclusion
I try to engage in promoting inclusion e.g. 
* by holding presentations about work-life balance with autism and my pilot project at ETH.

## Autism Acceptance Month Challenge
In 2025 I took part in the autism acceptance month challenge on Instagram. Some excerpts of it you can find in this section. If you want to see the full posts check them out on my [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/estrellamenti/).

### Day 1 - Dispel a myth
Myth: High functioning equals low support needs.
Just because my struggles are less visible doesn't mean I need and deserve less support. 

(This is especially frustrating as social money usually is coupled to functioning instead of support needs. Resulting in many autistic people being denied the support they need because it is not visible enough.)

Functioning examples: 
- living on my own
- being verbal
- being able to work

Invisible support needs examples: 
- needing somebody to take over cooking, cleaning and laundry or I won't have energy left for job or freetime
- needing somebody to do phone calls for me as one 5 min call takes about three hours for me to regenerate that energy
- having an autism coach translating to me what neurotypicals mean and doing the same in reverse for my assistants
- needing weekly sessions with my psychiatrist because I need the outside perspective on my daily challenges. My continual struggle to prevent autistic downs, my daily or even hourly changing capacities due to energy losses like change of plans. Helping me with selfconpassion on my inabilities and recognizing which barriers hindered me so that I don't place blame on myself.

### Day 2 - Sensory Items
I have in almost each of my rooms at least one box with fidget toys. But since having my assistance dog Nayla I actually don’t need them so often any longer. Cuddling and petting her is just the best stimming I can get.

### Day 3 - Autistic Joy
Engaging in special interests is my main source of autistic joy. But also stimming can feel immensely satisfying. Each time I hear the cry of a kite (kind of bird) my face contorts into a smile. I only notice by my body reaction that this experience makes me happy. My emotions are often not as easily accessible to me as it seems to be the case for neurotypicals. Also the sound of thunder, or of a cat purring I like very much. I love storms, walking in the forest (when there is no storm), and deep diving into hyperfocus. I love experiencing the beauty of nature. I love picturing strange worlds be it through astrophysics, scify or high fantasy. I do like socializing, too. With animals that is easy for me but with humans it leaves me exhausted so I need to be careful, always planning in breaks inbetween and recovery time afterwards.

I can find immense joy in little details like the beauty of a waterdroplet on a leaf or abstract concepts like justice. 

As I struggle with mental illness (depressive thoughts, almost daily fighting to prevent autistic downs, internalized ableism,…) I have learned many strategies to battle it. One very important one for me is gratitude journaling. First noticing, then appreciating and now being grateful for the good things in my life. It is how I trained my brain to be more positive and aware of the good stuff. Through it I also realized that I am the most content when I feel my deep bond with my pets. And when being aware of the many amazing people who support me.

### Day 4 - Sensory friendly clothing
This is such a challenge! Requirements:
- Long soft undergarment because otherwise I get a rash from the roughness of the fabric (e.g. jeans fabric is too rough) or spiky pet hairs poking through.
- Top layer fabric so that cat and dog hairs don’t stick too much. (No wool, fleece,...)
- Top layer color so that cat and dog hairs don’t show so much (Not white because of black Nayla hair. Not black because of white Estrella hair. Anything else is at best medium because of the multicolored hairs of Estrella.)
- Top layer robust fabric to not get immediately holes from cat claws.
- I ended up with wearing hiking shoes all the time because they are the only ones I can lash tightly enough so that I don’t feel them moving. Otherwise even the fabric from the end of my trousers moving over my socks will be enough to cause a rash.
- You might have noticed on other pictures that I wear gloves almost all the time. Those are because of my chronic skin problems on my hands. Though I have found that it is actually quite nice for my autism, too. Getting in contact with dog saliva or dirty surfaces bothers me less this way.
- Main issue: I need to wear my clothes for a few weeks before I can tell if they work for me. By that time the same garment is usually no longer available to reorder in bulk. Fortunately I have found a few slow fashion brands e.g. ASKET that work for me

### Day 5 - Special interests

My special interests are astrophysics, animals and inclusion. Special interest means, that I am fascinated by it never getting bored to learn more on the topic.

What I love about astrophysics is that in its scales my daily (or even humanities) problems are unimportant. For example if I think in time scales it takes to form a planet or how the universe started. Similarly in distance scales from the sizes of stars to clusters of galaxies. My interest in astronomy started already in primary school but more than the pretty pictures I like to know and to understand how it all works.

I have always been fascinated by animals. The neighbours pet’s, wild animals, animal toys … and animal dictionaries. I made my mother read them to me when I was not able to read myself yet. Still today those are some of my favorite books. It is just calming for me to open it at a random page and read about an animal species. It is also way more intuitive for me to interact with animals. I will use any chance I get to do so as it just gives me pleasure. And I am also very good at training animals. I can easily place myself in the situation of an animal and assess what it would want out of an interaction with me.

When my autism coach started teaching me what autism really was I started understanding how neurotypicals see the world, and what a big difference there is between our experiences. In order to find more strategies to make my life easier I researched more and more about autism. And the more I did the more it started to develop into a special interest. Given my many addiditonal marginalized identities I soon found out that what actually interested me was Equity and Inclusion.

### Day 6 - My dream sensory space
Each evening we cuddle as a family on the couch. The weight and warmth of my pets, the feel of their soft fur, the purring from Estrella reverberating through me. That is kind of my dream sensory space. But if I could have anything I wanted, it would be a holodeck (from Star Trek). That way I could go to any place I wanted and adapt my surroundings exactly how I like. I could also stop the experience at any time. Most likely I would go to all kinds of different nature environments (forests, beaches, mountains,…). The most important part about it would be the control over my sensory environment.
Another idea would be having cat trees for humans. I am often envious at what nice places Estrella can hang out at.

### Day 7 - Autistic authors
My three favorite books about autism by autistic authors (two in german, one in english):

- Schattenspringer von Daniela Schreiter: Graphic Novel über Kindheit und Jugend einer autistische Frau aus Deutschland. Liebevoll gezeichnet und Autismus gut erklärend.
- Welcome to the autistic community (book also available free to read [online](https://autismacceptance.com/read-the-book/)): Eye opening and in my estimation a must for every autistic ally or autistic person.
- Anders nicht falsch von Maria Zimmermann: Was herauskommt wenn eine Autistin spät eine Diagnose bekommt und sich ein paar Monate mit Hyperfokus zum Thema Autismus schlau macht um sich selbst verstehenzulernt. Was ich daran schätze: Einfache Sprache, Buch ist schnell gelesen, Autismus ist mega gut erklärt, affirmativ statt pathologisierend, nach neustem Konsensus der Forschung und Neurodiversitätsbewegung.

### Day 8 - Autistic inclusion looks like
Less what autistic inclusion looks like and more how to get closer to it:

The path of acceptance: Concept from the queer movement and was coined by Dr. Vivienne Cass 1979. I adapted it from Jessica McCabe's book "How to ADHD" and an Ace Dad Advice video.
1. Anti
You deny the existence of autism or of me being autistic. Example: Autism is just a fashionable diagnosis.
2. Acknowledgement
You recognize autism exists but still have misconceptions. Example: You don't look autistic.
3. Acceptance
You recognize that autistic brains work differently from most and that through marginalization those differences create real impairments. You believe my experience of it. Example: I didn't realize executive functioning difficulties was an aspect of autism. That makes sense.
4. Affirming
You ask and listen about my experiences. You encourage me to get the support I need, and offer accommodations. Example: Thank you for telling me you have difficulties keeping to your scheduled breaks. Would it help if I remind you?
5. Advocate
You acknowledge power and agency to act. Example: You speak up for autistic people, even when they're not in the room. You offer support to autistic people without them having to ask.

It took a lot of pressure from me when I realized that it is not my job to educate others. I can choose when I want to do so and it is enough to try to get others from one step to the next. No need to try to push them to the end. 

### Day 9 - Autigender

I believe my autism shapes my gender quite a bit. I disclosed some on Instagram but on the webpage I don't feel comfortable with that (yet). Instead here some links to ressources:
