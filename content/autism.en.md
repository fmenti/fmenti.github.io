# What is Autism?

I like the definition of [Refrainingautism](https://reframingautism.org.au/about-autism/) very well:

"We think of Autism as a brain difference that is basic and fundamental to who we are. This means that Autism is an important part of who we are and the way we are in the world.

Autistic people develop differently to non-autistic people. Autistic people think, move, interact, sense and process differently to what people might expect. We also have more qualities and characteristics in common with other Autistic people than with non-autistic people. Each person is different, but Autistic people will be different to non-autistic people in the way we:

* Socialise and communicate,  including the way we connect, make and understand friendships and relationships, and use speech and body language
* Think and process,  including the way we see patterns and connections, imagine and play, experience and express our senses, emotions and executive functioning, and in the way our brains develop

These differences can look different for children and adults. "

# Vertrausenhund (Assistance dog)

In my day to day life I am supported by my assistance dog for adult autistic people, a so called [Vertrauenshund](vertrauenshund.ch) from [Blindenhundeschule Liestal](https://www.blindenhund.ch).

# Inclusion
I try to engage in promoting inclusion e.g. 
* by holding presentations about work-life balance with autism and my pilot project at ETH.

## Autism Acceptance Month Challenge
In 2025 I took part in the autism acceptance month challenge on Instagram. Some excerpts of it you can find in this section. If you want to see the full posts check them out on my [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/estrellamenti/).

### Day 1 - Dispel a myth
Myth: High functioning equals low support needs.
Just because my struggles are less visible doesn't mean I need and deserve less support. 

(This is especially frustrating as social money usually is coupled to functioning instead of support needs. Resulting in many autistic people being denied the support they need because it is not visible enough.)

Functioning examples: 
- living on my own
- being verbal
- being able to work

Invisible support needs examples: 
- needing somebody to take over cooking, cleaning and laundry or I won't have energy left for job or freetime
- needing somebody to do phone calls for me as one 5 min call takes about three hours for me to regenerate that energy
- having an autism coach translating to me what neurotypicals mean and doing the same in reverse for my assistants
- needing weekly sessions with my psychiatrist because I need the outside perspective on my daily challenges. My continual struggle to prevent autistic downs, my daily or even hourly changing capacities due to energy losses like change of plans. Helping me with selfconpassion on my inabilities and recognizing which barriers hindered me so that I don't place blame on myself.

### Day 2 - Sensory Items
I have in almost each of my rooms at least one box with fidget toys. But since having my assistance dog Nayla I actually don’t need them so often any longer. Cuddling and petting her is just the best stimming I can get.

### Day 3 - Autistic Joy
Engaging in special interests is my main source of autistic joy. But also stimming can feel immensely satisfying. Each time I hear the cry of a kite (kind of bird) my face contorts into a smile. I only notice by my body reaction that this experience makes me happy. My emotions are often not as easily accessible to me as it seems to be the case for neurotypicals. Also the sound of thunder, or of a cat purring I like very much. I love storms, walking in the forest (when there is no storm), and deep diving into hyperfocus. I love experiencing the beauty of nature. I love picturing strange worlds be it through astrophysics, scify or high fantasy. I do like socializing, too. With animals that is easy for me but with humans it leaves me exhausted so I need to be careful, always planning in breaks inbetween and recovery time afterwards.

I can find immense joy in little details like the beauty of a waterdroplet on a leaf or abstract concepts like justice. 

As I struggle with mental illness (depressive thoughts, almost daily fighting to prevent autistic downs, internalized ableism,…) I have learned many strategies to battle it. One very important one for me is gratitude journaling. First noticing, then appreciating and now being grateful for the good things in my life. It is how I trained my brain to be more positive and aware of the good stuff. Through it I also realized that I am the most content when I feel my deep bond with my pets. And when being aware of the many amazing people who support me.
