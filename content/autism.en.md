# What is Autism?

I like the definition of [Refrainingautism](https://reframingautism.org.au/about-autism/) very well:

"We think of Autism as a brain difference that is basic and fundamental to who we are. This means that Autism is an important part of who we are and the way we are in the world.

Autistic people develop differently to non-autistic people. Autistic people think, move, interact, sense and process differently to what people might expect. We also have more qualities and characteristics in common with other Autistic people than with non-autistic people. Each person is different, but Autistic people will be different to non-autistic people in the way we:

* Socialise and communicate,  including the way we connect, make and understand friendships and relationships, and use speech and body language
* Think and process,  including the way we see patterns and connections, imagine and play, experience and express our senses, emotions and executive functioning, and in the way our brains develop

These differences can look different for children and adults. "

# Assistance dog - Vertrausenhund

In my day to day life I am supported by my assistance dog for adult autistic people, a so called [Vertrauenshund](vertrauenshund.ch) from [Blindenhundeschule Liestal](https://www.blindenhund.ch).

# Inclusion
I try to engage in promoting inclusion e.g. 
* by holding presentations about work-life balance with autism and my pilot project at ETH.

* Autism Acceptance Month Challenge 2025 through posts on Instagram (more about this coming soon)
