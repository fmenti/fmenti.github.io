Hi, I'm Franziska! 👋

I am a research software engineer in astrophysics at ETH Zurich where I work in the exoplanets and habitability group of Prof. Sascha Quanz.
Most of my research is driven by designing and implementing the LIFE (Large Interferometer For Exoplanets https://life-space-mission.com/) target database.

In my free time, I like interacting with animals🐕, playing (board) games and helping our society become more inclusive!

Please feel free to get in touch! 📧
