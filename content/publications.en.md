# Employment

After finishing my master at ETH Zurich I am now employed through [Workaut](https://workaut.ch/) which offers a program for inclusion of autistic people in workplaces. You can read more about it in the article of the ETH community magazine that featured me:

# Vertrauenshund

In my day to day live I am supported by my assistance dog for adult autistic people, a so-called Vertrauenshund, from [Blindenhundeschule Liestal](https://www.blindenhund.ch). In the magazine of the association you can read more about it (though you might need a translation software as it is in German):
